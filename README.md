devman
======
Manage your git repositories with your Workflow in mind.

 * Fork this repo
 * Create your configuration files
 * Clone devman from your fork (you and your team)
 * Use devman
 * Stay up to date with our repository (fetch upstream)
 * Send a pull request to add new features

**Use case**

 * You have many teams working on different sets of repos and want a centralized, clear way to tell people what repo they need to clone for which project.

 * You have multiple systems and want them to always have the same repos. (ie: desktop & laptop)

 * You work on multiple projects that contain multiple repos and want to manage them from a unique tool.

 * You are somewhat bored of cd'ing into your repos and want to control a specific repo, or group from any shell.

 * You are most tired of clicking on your GUI to update all your repos and want to get up to speed with CLI users. ;-)

## Prerequisites

  - git is installed on your system (or msysgit on cygwin)

  - python is installed on your system.

  - your github ssh access is configured for
    * key-based access or
    * https access (using a .netrc file) or
    * using git-credential-winstore plugin (Windows)
